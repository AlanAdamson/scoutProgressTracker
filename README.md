#Scout Progress Tracker
###Plan:
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Create a tracking app, online and or mobile, for tracking the progress of a cub or boy scout; specifically for BSA.*

###Ideas:
  - Make as easy as possible to use.
  - User will be able to:
    - create login
    - create up to 30 scouts to track (feel that going above 30 may cause bugs)
    - select list of badges and awards wanting to work on
      - view list of requirements that were selected
    - view list of competed badges, requirements.
    - view complete list of badges and awards
      - select badges from clomplete list and see what requirements are still needed to complete
