#Scout Progress Tracker
###Plan:
   *Create a tracking app, online and or mobile, for tracking the progress of a cub or boy scout; specifically for BSA.*
  <h3>Ideas:</h3>
  - Make as easy as possible to use.
  - User will be able to:
  
    1. create login
    2. create up to 30 scouts to track (feel that going above 30 may cause bugs)
    3. select list of badges and awards wanting to work on
    4. view list of competed badges, requirements.
    5. view complete list of badges and awards
      - select them and see requirements to complete
